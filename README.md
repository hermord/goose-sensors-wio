# Goose 3 Sensors
This repository contains code and supporting code for the sensors on the Goose 3 Hyperloop Pod.

The AVR code is developed with [Cosa](https://github.com/mikaelpatel/Cosa)
using Waterloop's build toolchain [wio](https://github.com/waterloop/wio).
WLib is included as STL.

## Development Dependencies
Developing the sensor code requires
* `cmake`
* `avr-gcc` or Arduino SDK
* `wio`

See the wio readme for more information.
