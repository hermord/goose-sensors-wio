# TMP36 temperature sensor

This is a standard Arduino temperature sensor;
a wealth of information can be found in external sources.
Temperature measured must be in the range -40...+125°C;
the accuracy is ±2°C.

To wire up this sensor, connect the pins as shown here:

DIAGAM pending.

It is also possible to use the 3.3 V pin as the voltage source.
